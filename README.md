# Our Mission
improve crypto and mobile UX by allowing open source customization in the mobile space


Today, cryptocurrency technology is not properly applied to the mobile space, and unfortunately existing efforts do not seem to meaningfully enhance privacy and user choice, so we have decided to step into the fray by introducing a new set of user experience primitives based around replacing phone numbers with a `seed phrase` which is generated on devices with user-supplied entropy at first boot, which can be backed up, but can never be deleted on the mobile device except by factory reset.
